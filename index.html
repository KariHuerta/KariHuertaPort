				<span>I always strive to improve everything I work on.  There is nothing more satisfying than putting something together that not only fills a need but makes it better, faster and more appealing.  It's not just about creating something that people will use, it's about creating something people want to use and all the aspects that go along with that.  When design, functionality and uniqueness come together to create something amazing.</span>
