					<h3>Data Analytics</h3>
					<p>14 years ago, I inherited a database to run to create reports for one of the business units in our company.  When I started I did not know anything about MS Access or SQL.  The business unit realized that some of the reports were wrong as well as needing to have some new reports created.  I began to research how everything worked so I could identify how I could resolve the issue.  Once I was done, I had not only fixed the reports but had everything running faster and smoother.  Later, I transitioned into the Analytics and Reporting department where I worked on creating efficiencies in existing reports and eventually started creating new reports.  Now, I create and manage all regulatory and audit reporting as well as creating dashboards for management.</p>
					<h3>Web Programming</h3>
					<p>10 years ago, I was told that I needed to start using SharePoint.  The quality control business unit needed a workflow created so they could manage quality scores and create scorecards.  Everything I had learned online was that I needed to use jQuery to accomplish the things they needed.  I started teaching myself how to use javascript and jQuery to customize the SharePoint list forms.  The more I started diving into it, the more requests I had for SharePoint workflows to be created and I ended up learning HTML, CSS, CAMLQuery and Ajax as well to accomplish the things that they needed.  I decided after a few years that I should go to school for Web Programming so that I could solidify my skills.  I learned a lot from those classes that helped fill in gaps in my knowledge from teaching myself.  After I got the certification I started cleaning up the code I had created to make it more efficient and improve the overall quality.</p>
					<p>When I sat down to think about what it is that I love about Data Analytics and Web Programming I realized that what I love about them is the same thing.  I love to help people and get them what they need.  As my skills have grown over the years, Iâ€™ve been able to add more design and depth to create a more user friendly experience for things that they use every day.  The most satisfying part is to see how happy and surprised someone is when they need something but what is provided is better than they expected.  That is what I know I can do with product management as well.  They all have the same end goal, to create a product that someone not only needs but is something that they want and are excited about.</p>
